WebSocket Tester
-----------------

This code is a companion to my tutorial, 
HTML5 and JavaScript WebSockets using MVC
http://tonygaitatzis.tumblr.com/post/61028281192/html5-and-javascript-websockets-using-mvc

It is a WebSocket Client for manual content exchange between your 
browser and a websocket server.  It can run from your hard disk,
if you load websockettester.html in your browser.  It does not need
to be installed on a web server.

Give it a spin and try connecting it to the echo websocket server at
ws://echo.websocket.org

It is programmed with Twitter Bootstrap, FontAwesome, JQuery, and
Model-View-Controller architecture, feauturing a Handler design pattern
for processing the server response in the UI.
